# Plant Vigil – Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

Plant Vigil is a deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed in PyTorch. The model classifies images into 39 plant disease categories and is trained on the PlantVillage dataset. This application is intended for use in agricultural diagnostics and educational or research purposes.

## Project Features

* Image classification using a CNN trained on the PlantVillage dataset
* 39 different plant disease categories
* Flask-based web application for real-time predictions
* Supplement and fertilizer suggestions based on prediction
* Easily testable with included leaf images
* Open-source and open to community contributions

## Running the Project Locally

Prerequisites:

* Python 3.8 installed on your system

Steps to set up:

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-vigil.git
cd plant-vigil
```

2. Set Up Virtual Environment
   Refer to the official Python venv guide or use:

```bash

## Testing the Model

A folder named `test_images/` is included with the repository. You can use these images to test the functionality of the model. Each image corresponds to a specific disease category to help verify the accuracy of predictions.

## AI Involvement

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence, specifically Deep Learning, to automate the detection of plant diseases from leaf images. The core of the application is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using the PyTorch framework.

The CNN model has been trained on the publicly available PlantVillage dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. Using supervised learning, the model learns to identify complex patterns and visual cues associated with 39 different plant disease categories.

Once trained, the AI model is capable of performing real-time inference through the web application, classifying user-uploaded images and providing accurate disease predictions. This approach significantly reduces manual inspection effort and provides a scalable solution for early disease detection in agriculture.
