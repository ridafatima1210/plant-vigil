Plant Vigil â€“ Plant Disease Detection using Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning
==========================================================

Plant Vigil is a deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed in PyTorch. The model classifies images into 39 plant disease categories and is trained on the PlantVillage dataset. This application is intended for use in agricultural diagnostics and educational or research purposes.
